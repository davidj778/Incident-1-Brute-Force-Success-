# Incident 1 - Brute Force Success (Windows) - Working Incidents and Incident Response

Handle the incidents generated within Azure Sentinel, following the NIST 800-61 Incident Management Lifecycle protocol.

<h2>Step 1: Preparation</h2>
We integrated all logs into the Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel, along with setting up alert rules.

<h2>Step 2: Detection & Analysis</h2>
